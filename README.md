# Escape_Plan v2.3
A script by Goodman (or my other names) For any questions contact me on Discord via Goodman#4723    
Intended for SCP Containment Breach Multiplayer. Particularly Breach Mode Servers.  
Script will allow escapees to escape through either gate and join their respective teams even if it is not the gate they're meant to escape from.   
Script will also makes handcuffed escapees to join the enemy team even if they escape through their own gate.   

Installation Guide
1. Download escapeplan.gsc and add to dedicated server tool folder.  
2. Open server.cfg (already in the folder)
3. Write `script escapeplan.gsc` into the file.
4. The file should now load when the server is started
