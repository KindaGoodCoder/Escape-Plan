# Escape_Plan
A script by Goodman (or my other names)
Intended for SCP Containment Breach Multiplayer. Particularly Breach Mode Servers.
Script will allow escapees to escape through either gate and join their respective teams even if it is not the gate they're meant to escape from.
Script will also makes handcuffed escapees to join the enemy team even if they escape through their own gate.
